Project 4, CSC 321
CST 321 Instructor: Zhen Jiang                         Project 4.
									
Assignment. 
1.	Download and install Java and MySql in a laptop. 
2.	Download the sample umlDemo.zip from the content folder in D2L. Run the program with the cases analyzed in UML_Demo.docx.
3.	Implementation your own java application program Walkthrough.java. This program (limited in one class implementation only) must:
  a.	Keep accepting user’s command (or selection) until he/she chooses to stop.
  b.	Use Trans class from Trans.java, and make any slight change if necessary (for instance, the account name, password, or different 
      connection manner in your local computer tested in TestMysql.java) to realize the following functionalities in the MySql server:
        i.	Create a new table,
        ii.	Insert a new row (i.e., entity),
        iii.	Select some records (elective by using “where”) in one column and display them in the application side. 
4.	Make an appointment to demonstrate the execution in instructor’s office. The instructor will use your Walkthough.java and his own Trans.
    java to check the above functionalities in his computer. That is, your Walkthough.java should be platform-free, irrelevant to any 
    account in use, password check, or JDBC connector. 

Evaluation (200pts): 
Step 1 (by April 23th) 
  •	Install MySQL and JDK in a laptop. Use TestMysql.java (available at www.cs.wcupa.edu/~zjiang/TestMysql.java) to confirm the JDBC 
    connection with the server of MySQL. 
  •	Demo your testing work when you come to class on April 23th. 

Step 2 (by April 30th, but can start as soon as possible after seeing two “ok” from the above execution of TestMysql.java)  
  •	Design testing cases to cover the requirement (of creation, insertion, and selection) in the above. By running your program with these 
    testing cases, you show how the requirement is met. 
  •	Debug your program if there is any compiling or running error. 
  •	Submit your executable Walkthough.java to D2L as a registration for the demo in the next step. 

Step 3 (by May 6th)
  •	Email the instructor to schedule the time before 5/6 for an execution demo in his office. First-come-first-serve policy is adopted here.
    Student work is accepted for the grading only when  both email reservation and D2L source code are received.  
  •	During the demo in the instructor’s office, student will be asked to make a slight change of the code and rerun these testing cases. 
  •	After that, student will be asked to upload the final version to D2L. 
  •	The project will not be graded until a student can successfully accomplish all above (from 1st step).
